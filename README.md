# ultrakarel-video
Script to play video on CodeHS UltraKarel python.

# Requirements
- A new-ish Python (latest recommended, but it's probably fine as long as it supports shutil and the other requirements)
- cv2-python
- Python Image Library

# Instructions
Create a new folder, put `videoconvert.py` into it, and download your video. Run `videoconvert.py` from the folder you created and follow the instructions.

## Note
The script does resize your video to a square so its recommended to crop it beforehand unless you are fine with a little bit of squish or stretch.

On CodeHS, open up the Sandbox and create a new project. Set it to UltraKarel under python. Then, once in the project, paste the contents of `karel.py` into it, and the contents of `animation.txt` at the comment.
